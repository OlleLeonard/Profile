    <h1>About Olle L Mattsson</h1>
    <b>Hey!</b>
<p>
I am a happy and curious leisure and art teacher of 30 years who is looking for a new job.
</p>
<p>I am looking for a job with the opportunity to spread my knowledge and ideas and gather new experiences together with wonderful colleagues.
</p>
<p>
During my previous employment as a teacher in arts and leisure I strived to give my students the opportunity to develop their creative thought process to be able to create and express themselves in new ways.
</p>
<p>
As a work colleague, I often contribute with a light-hearted mood and ideas to develop the business.
</p>
<p>
After five years of professional experience in school, I have now started to think again and come to the conclusion that I want to work with IT.
</p>
<p>I am currently taking a course in Front-end Development where I learn about HTML, CSS, Javacript and Git etc.
</p>
<p>I look forward to a new journey where I get to learn a lot in a new form of business.
</p>

<b>I look forward to hearing from you!</b>
<p>Sincerely</p>
<h3>Olle Mattsson</h3>
